    This function is in charge of determining whether someone is allowed onto a
    roller coaster. If they are greater than 5'6", then the value "allowed"
    should be returned. Otherwise, "nope" should be returned.

    Hints:
    - If they're 4 feet tall (or shorter), inches don't matter: they're too short.
    - If they're 6 feet tall (or taller), inches don't matter: they're allowed.
    - Only when they're 5 feet tall do we actually have to check the inches part

    :param height_ft: The height of the patron in feet
    :param height_in: The remaining inches of the patron's height
